# Zero Knowledge Sabotage Game

Initial input:
- List of players (public)
- Protecting fee
- Sabotage penalty
- Failed sabotage penalty

ZK input:
- Player action (sabotage or self-protect)

Players can choose to sabotage other players, resulting in them losing some of their points. Multiple sabotages on the same player will only count as a single sabotage.

If a player has chosen to pay the self-protection fee, all sabotages will be void.
