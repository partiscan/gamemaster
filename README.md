# Gamemaster Monorepo

This is the monorepo for the Gamemaster project, which combines arcade-style gaming with blockchain technology. It contains the frontend interface and smart contracts required for setting up and running "Arcades," which are collections of games.

## Motivation
The idea was to showcase some of the unique and awesome features of Partisia Blockchain.

The project showcases several unique features of the Partisia Blockchain, including:
- Secret State: Ensuring the privacy of game actions.
- Computation on Secrets: Performing calculations on encrypted data without revealing it.
- Secret Conditionals: Making decisions based on secret information without exposing the underlying data.


## Structure

The monorepo is divided into two main parts:

- `contracts/`: Contains the Partisia Blockchain smart contracts.
- `web/`: Contains the Typescript frontend code for Gamemaster.
